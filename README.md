# Gamble-Device

A device which provides propellantless propulsion according to former employees at Boeing Aerospace.
This device may sink momentum as gravitational waves, via gravitomagnetic effects.

If this functions properly, it will easily replace ion drives, producing similar or greater thrust per power input. This suggests that the energy/momentum ratio of gravitons may be different than for photons.
